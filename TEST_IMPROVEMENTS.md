## Current Testing Status

### Smart Contract Tests

- **Coverage**: Moderate to high coverage of main contract functions
- **Strengths**: Basic functionality testing, some error cases
- **Weaknesses**: Limited edge case testing, insufficient access control testing

### TypeScript Client Tests

- **Coverage**: 
  - Base Client: ~53.48% line coverage
  - Utils: ~37.5% line coverage 
  - AggregatorGateway: ~27.77% line coverage
  - AggregatorNode: ~14% line coverage
- **Strengths**: Basic functionality tests, type conversion testing
- **Weaknesses**: Heavy reliance on mocks, limited test of error handling

### Integration Tests

- **Coverage**: Limited to happy path testing
- **Strengths**: Full end-to-end testing with real contract interaction
- **Weaknesses**: Limited scenario coverage, no edge cases

## Smart Contract Testing Improvements

### 1. Increase Test Coverage for Edge Cases

- **Access Control Tests**:
  - Test all owner-only functions with non-owner accounts
  - Test aggregator-only functions with non-aggregator accounts
  - Test the effects of adding and removing aggregators

- **Error Condition Tests**:
  - Test all require statements and custom error conditions
  - Ensure proper reversion with appropriate error messages
  - Test boundary conditions (e.g., min/max values)

- **State Transition Tests**:
  - Test state transitions for batches (unprocessed → processed)
  - Test commitment lifecycle (submission → batch inclusion → processing)
  - Test concurrent operations from multiple aggregators

### 2. Implement Fuzz Testing

- Add property-based tests using Foundry's fuzzing capabilities
- Test with randomly generated:
  - Commitment payloads and authenticators
  - Batch sizes and configurations
  - Aggregator counts and voting thresholds

### 3. Gas Optimization Tests

- Add explicit tests for gas consumption
- Set gas usage thresholds for critical functions
- Test gas usage under various load conditions

### 4. Contract Interaction Tests

- Test interactions between contracts if multiple contracts are involved
- Test upgrade paths if the contract is upgradeable
- Test compatibility with external systems or standards

## TypeScript Client Testing Improvements

### 1. Increase Unit Test Coverage

- **UniCityAnchorClient**:
  - Complete tests for all public methods
  - Test initialization with various configuration options
  - Test error handling and retries

- **AggregatorGatewayClient**:
  - Add tests for batch creation logic
  - Test commitment submission with various payload types
  - Test error handling and recovery

- **AggregatorNodeClient**:
  - Implement tests for batch processing logic
  - Test hashroot generation and submission
  - Test the SMT (Sparse Merkle Tree) implementation

- **Utils**:
  - Add tests for edge cases in conversion functions
  - Test with various input types and sizes
  - Test error handling for invalid inputs

### 2. Improve Mock Quality

- Create more realistic mocks of contract interactions
- Simulate various response patterns from the blockchain
- Test retry and timeout handling with flaky mocks

### 3. Add Negative Testing

- Test handling of:
  - Network failures
  - Transaction rejections
  - Invalid responses
  - Concurrent client operations

### 4. Test Event Handling

- Test event subscription and handling
- Verify event data processing
- Test event-based state management

## Integration Testing Improvements

### 1. Expand Test Scenarios

- **Complex Workflow Tests**:
  - Test multiple commitments in a single batch
  - Test multiple batches with dependencies
  - Test parallel operations from multiple clients

- **Failure Recovery Tests**:
  - Test system recovery after node failures
  - Test transaction reverts and retries
  - Test network disconnection and reconnection

- **Multi-Aggregator Tests**:
  - Test with multiple aggregators submitting different hashrooots
  - Test threshold voting with various aggregator counts
  - Test aggregator addition/removal during active batches

### 2. Stress Testing

- Test system under high load:
  - Many concurrent commitment submissions
  - Rapid batch creation and processing
  - Large payloads and batch sizes

### 3. Long-Running Tests

- Implement extended tests that run over longer periods
- Test system stability over time
- Test handling of blockchain reorganizations

### 4. Performance Testing

- Measure and establish baselines for:
  - Transaction throughput
  - Latency for key operations
  - Resource usage (memory, CPU)

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

- **Automated Test Pipeline**:
  - Run all test types in CI
  - Maintain test history and trends
  - Set coverage thresholds for PRs

- **Test Reports**:
  - Generate detailed test reports
  - Track coverage trends over time
  - Highlight problem areas

### 2. Test Environment Management

- **Reproducible Test Environments**:
  - Use Docker for consistent test environments
  - Provide deterministic blockchain state
  - Parameterize tests for different configurations

- **Test Data Management**:
  - Create fixtures for common test scenarios
  - Generate test data programmatically
  - Maintain test state between runs

### 3. Debugging Tools
