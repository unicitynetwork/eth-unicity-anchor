## System Overview

The Ethereum Unicity Anchor provides a trustless framework for processing user commitments with guaranteed consistency across all participants. It enables multiple trusted aggregator services to collect, process, and verify commitment requests in an orderly, immutable manner.

### Key Features

- **Commitment Management**: Secure submission and validation of user commitments
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient organization of commitments into sequential batches
- **Hashroot Consensus**: Multi-aggregator voting system for verification
- **Sequential Processing**: Strict ordering of batch processing for data consistency
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized aggregators can submit data or hashroots

### Core Workflow

1. Users submit commitment requests through aggregator gateways
2. Aggregator gateways validate and forward commitments to the smart contract
3. The smart contract stores commitments in an unprocessed pool
4. Aggregator gateways trigger batch creation
5. Aggregator services process batches by computing SMT hashroots
6. Aggregators submit hashroots to the smart contract
7. When sufficient aggregators agree on a hashroot, the batch is marked as processed
